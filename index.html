            <h1>About Zach</h1>
            <p>I am a new web developer who loves to learn. The tech industry is a new development for me.
                I used to work in healthcare and decided to change directions. I don't regret it one bit!
                I also love to ride my bicycle, play music and hang out with friends and family. I 
                am excited to be part of the Full Sail community and look forward
                to learning great things in this class!</p>

            <h1>Components</h1>
            <img src="img/components/ellipse.jpg" alt="ellipse">
            <p>I would like to create an placeholder type ellipse, that let's users know where they
                are in the stack.</p>                
            <img src="img/components/grid.jpg" alt="photo-grid">
            <p>I would like to create a photo grid. I think these can be very pleasing to the eye and
                easy to navigate.</p>
            <img src="img/components/zoom.jpg" alt="photo-zoom">
            <p>Since this is a screen-shot, you can't see the subtle zoom effect when the user hovers
                over the image with a mouse. I think if this is done right in can provide an exciting 
                alternative to static images.</p>
            <img src="img/components/asym.jpg" alt="asymmetrical">
            <p>I would really like to learn how to create asymmetrical components. I just think they
                look cool, but they also catch the attention of the user. This is also something I think
                needs to be done in moderation. Just because you can so something doesn't mean you should.</p>
            <img src="img/components/cta.jpg" alt="cta">
            <p>I have always been a fan of full-width banners and I think their popularity proves that
                I'm not the only one who thinks so. A full width CTA (perhaps a slider?) will be my primary
                component.</p>
